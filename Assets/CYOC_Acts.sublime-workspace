In the darkness that follows, you see cloaked men, and horrible things that can not possibly exist. You see the end of all times, or at least your end.\nEntryText:  \nEntryText:  Your adventure has ended. \nEntryText:  \nEntryText:  Welcome to a pine box.\n\nChoice:The End\nAction:END_GAME\n\n\nEntryID:-1\nEntryText:  You have gone insane. Your mind reels from the impossibility of it all, then finally snaps. You see things that can not be possible.\nEntryText:  \nEntryText:  Your adventure has ended. \nEntryText:  \nEntryText:  Welcome to a padded room.\n\nChoice:The End\nAction:END_GAME\n\nEntryID:0\nEntryText:  The year is 1925.  \nEntryText:  A telegram arrived for you late last night. It informed you of the death of Gerith Coleman, an uncle you did not even know you had. In his will, Jerith left his entire estate to you.\nEntryText:  Accord to the telegram, the estate consists of the home and lands at 15607 Old Hill Rd just outside of Arkham Massachussets. You live in Arkham, so it is a fairly short drive out to the area of Old Hill Road. \nEntryText:  You are not familiar with the area, but you know where it is, and as luck would have it, you had no other plans for the day. Therefore, you decided that you should drive out there today and examine your new property. \nEntryText:  Maybe it, or something within, will be worth something to you. At least, you will be able to learn more about this uncle that you did not even know you had.\nEntryAction:PLAY_MUSIC:SpiderEyes\nEntryAction:PLAY_ACT_ANIMATION:GameIntro\n\nChoice:Take the drive out to 15607 Old Hill Rd.\nAction:GOTO:1\n\n\nEntryID:1\nEntryText:  You begin the drive out to the house under overcast skies, and soon enough the heavens part and the rain begins to pour down. Your visibility is poor, and the road conditions worsen as you go.\nEntryText:  Old Hill Road cuts off a county road and you quickly find yourself creeping down what would better be called a muddy track than a road.\nEntryText:  The trees to either side of the road reach out over the muddy track. They do nothing to really protect from the rain in their current leafless state in late autumn.\nEntryText:  Now and then a wind picks up, blowing some of the fallen leaves across the road. Its the only real movement you've seen in some time. No one seems to care to come out this way, and you have seen another car for last several miles.\n\nChoice:Continue\nAction:GOTO:20\n\n\nEntryID:20\nNote:Drive to house, rain stops, hear noise around back, front door or head around back?\nEntryText:  The rain finally stops just before you pull up at the house, but the clouds stay gathered and low.\nEntryText:  You pull up at the address. A long driveway through an open gate leads back to the house. The gate itself is in desperate need of repair. The stone pillars on either side are cracked, with masonry crumbling off the top of the right one. With a bit of a sigh you pull into the drive.\nEntryText:  Driving through a tangle of trees, you finally catch sight of the house itself. It's in about the same condition as the drive gate. Massive vines snake up the side of the house with bushes in desperate need of trimming crowd the base. Old trees stretch toward the house as if trying to reach inside. \nEntryText:  In front of the house is a small circular parking area, with a separate drive stretching around the back. You park and step out, looking around. Behind the house you can here something going on. A rhythmic thud sounds now and again, as well as the clattering of something falling.\nEntryText:  The front door stands ahead of you, shadowed by the sagging old porch. \n\nChoice:Go to the front door.\nAction:GOTO:21\nChoice:Go around back to find out what the noise is.\nAction:GOTO:30\n\n\nEntryID:21\nNote:Front door, can try to open it, or knock.\nEntryText:  You step up onto the creaking floorboards of the front porch. Inside the house, you hear something scrambling around, then the deep barks of a what you assume is a large dog. \nEntryText:  The door is fairly solid looking, though the entire house looks like it could use a coat of paint and some general maintenance. A massive knocker hangs on the door, the large metal ring set into the mouth of a gruesome looking gargoyle face.\nEntryText:  You could use the large old metal knocker on the door, though the dog has probably alerted anyone inside of your presence. You were not really expecting anyone to be here, but the dog is obviously being cared for by someone.\nEntryText:  You could also just try to open the door, dog or no dog.\nEntryText:  Finally you could still go around back and find out what the noise you were hearing back there was.\n\nChoice:Knock on the door.\nAction:GOTO:22\nChoice:Try to open the door.\nAction:GOTO:23\nChoice:Walk around back.\nAction:GOTO:30\n\n\nEntryID:22\nEntryText:  You reach up and grab the large metal ring and give it a few swift raps against the metal plate beneath the gargoyle head. The dog inside barks louder than before, as if the use of the knocker just angers it further.\nEntryText:  You wait several minutes, but no one comes to answer the door. The dog never gives up its attempts to scare you away though.\n\nChoice:Try to open the door. You can handle the dog.\nAction:GOTO:23\nChoice:Walk around back.\nAction:GOTO:30\n\n\nEntryID:23\nNote: Trying the handle\nEntryText:  You reach down for the handle, ignoring the deep sounds of the barking dog on the other side of the door.  \nEntryText:  A quick check reveals that the front door is locked. \nEntryText:  When you were notified of your inheritance, there was no real communication about actually taking ownership. You don't have a key, and really have no idea how you will get one.\nEntryText:  You walk over to one of the windows on the porch and cup your hands against it, trying to see inside. It's no use, you can't see in through the grime on the window. Even if you could, you think you see that the curtains inside are closed.\n\nChoice:Try kicking the door down.\nAction:GOTO:24\nChoice:Knock on the door.\nAction:GOTO:22\nChoice:Walk around back.\nAction:GOTO:30\n\n\nEntryID:24\nNote:Kicking it down, dog attacks, caretaker comes in, grabs the dog, \nEntryText:  You rear back and kick the door near the handle. The door is really solid, but the frame it is set in must not be, for it splinters and the door slams open. \nEntryText:  It hurts for a moment, but you quickly get over it when you see the massive dog come lunging out of the darkness behind the door.\nEntryText:  You stumble back, falling off the porch with a yelp. Before you can react the dog is on you. You manage to thrust you arm in the way of its massive jaws, preventing it from biting your face off. \nEntryText:  It sinks its teeth into your arm and begins to shake. You scream in pain and punch the dog in the side of the head over and over until it finally relents and lets go. \nEntryText:  Just as it looks to be gathering steam for another lunge at you, a man behind it grabs its collar and yanks it backwards. He is older and gritty looking, carrying an axe in one hand, manhandling the massive dog with the other. He spits to one side then growls, \"Wondering when you were going to show up.\"\nEntryText:  \nEntryAction:MODIFY_ATTRIBUTE:CURRENT_PHYSICAL:-25\n\nChoice:Continue.\nAction:GOTO:31\n\n\nEntryID:30\nNote: Walk around back, see the caretaker cutting wood, interrupt him. He strides up...\nEntryText:  You walk around the back of the building along the secondary drive. Behind the house a small shack sits nestled against the forest, lights on inside. In front of the shack stands a man with an axe. \nEntryText:  As you watch he sets a section of a log on large block of wood and then swings the axe. With a loud thunk, the axe splits the wood with ease and the two pieces of wood clatter to the earth on either side. Without missing a beat he yanks the axe out and repeats the process.\nEntryText:  With each sharp thwack of the axe, the man easily splits large logs with a practiced ease. You get the uneasy feeling you would like to never get on the business end of that axe. \nEntryText:  You shudder at the gruesome thought, then call out, \"Excuse me.\"\nEntryText:  He doesn't miss a beat, axe falling to split another log even though he is now looking at you. \"What?\"\nEntryText:  \"I don't mean to intrude, but I need a word with you.\" He spits to one side of then chokes up on the axe and strides toward you. \nEntryText:  You swallow then straighten your clothes and move to meet him.\n\nChoice:Continue.\nAction:GOTO:31\n\n\nEntryID:31\nNote: Talking to the caretaker. \nEntryText:  The man frowns at you, then sighs, \"I'm James, the caretaker of the property.\" He sets the axe aside and looks you up and down. \nEntryText:  You begin to introduce yourself, but he interrupts, \"I know who you are. Who do you think sent you the telegram?\" He studies you a moment longer then turns away, \"Welcome to your new house.\"\nEntryText:  \"Thanks, I guess...\" You are not sure what to say next, so you add, \"I really didn't know my uncle at all...\"\nEntryText:  James turns back to look at you again, then shrugs slightly. \"He was a fair boss, and he left me the shack behind the house. I'll continue to take care of the house and grounds as best I can.\"\n\nChoice:Continue.\nAction:GOTO:32\n\n\nEntryID:32\nEntryText:  Nodding you ask him, \"What about the inside of the house? Who took care of that?\" You stare up at the large building wondering what it was your uncle actually did.\nEntryText:  \"That would just be you. Your uncle only had one really strict rule. No one in the house but himself. Ever. I've never set foot in the place. Don't see any reason to change that now. Besides. The place creeps me out.\" \nEntryText:  In the distance there is a flash of lightning and the rumble of thunder. James stares at the sky over the top of the trees around the house. \"I'll get the dog out of your way, and then you better get inside. There is a storm coming. You don't want to get caught unprepared. Oh, and here are the keys.\" He hands you a large set of keys to the house.\n\nChoice:Head inside before the storm comes.\nAction:GOTO:50\n\n\nEntryID:50\nNote: Exploring the house.\nEntryText:  The keys to your new home finally in hand, you step to the door. \nEntryText:  You turn from the two and look to the door. \nEntryText:  You look down at the set of keys and have to try one or two before you find one that finally fits the lock. You have to work at it a moment, as the old lock sticks, but finally you get it open. \nEntryText:  James takes the dog by the collar and drags him toward the shack out back. The entire time the dog barks and growls in your direction. James cuffs it with his free hand, \"Shut up.\" The dog doesn't seem to notice.\nEntryText:  Finally, you step inside, looking around. The place has definitely seen better days.\n\nChoice:Continue\nAction:GOTO:51\n\n\nEntryID:51\nEntryText:  You are in the foyer. Everything here is worn and old. The hardwood is scratched, the plaster is peeling from the walls, and the few bits of furniture are covered in dust, and in disrepair.\nEntryText:  The area is musty, and you can tell by the smell that the dog spends a good bit of time here. Tracks in the dust on the floor show patterns of traffic between the rooms, but in the corners the cobwebs and dust gather.\nEntryText:  Off to the left of the door is a sitting room, to the other side a large study. Ahead of you there is a massive staircase that leads up the second floor landing. A door beside the staircase hangs open and obviously leads to the back of the house. \n\nChoice:Head into the sitting room. \nAction:GOTO:60\nChoice:Go into the study.\nAction:GOTO:55\nChoice:Head up the stairs to the second floor landing.\nAction:GOTO:70\nChoice:Go through the door to back of the house. \nAction:REQUIREMENT_CHECK:HAVE_FLAG:Knife Taken\nActionCheckSuccess:GOTO:67\nActionCheckFailure:GOTO:66\n\n\nEntryID:55\nNote: Study\nEntryText:  Unlike the other areas on the ground floor of the house, this room looks like it has actually been used. One wall is covered in built ins and a large fireplace. In front of it sits a large comfortable chair with a small side table.\nEntryText:  Beside the chair sits a small oil lamp. Its handle is well worn, and the lamp seems to have gotten plenty of use.\nEntryText:  The bookshelf built around the fireplace is mostly bare, but one section is covered in old books. Another shelf contains several jars and other knick knacks.  \n\nChoice:Light a fire in the fireplace and have a rest.\nAction:GOTO:56\nRequirement:NOT_HAVE_FLAG:Fireplace Lit\nChoice:Take the lantern.\nAction:GOTO:57\nRequirement:NOT_HAVE_FLAG:Lantern Taken\nChoice:Examine the bookshelf.\nAction:GOTO:58\nChoice:Leave the study.\nAction:GOTO:51\n\n\nEntryID:56\nEntryText:  You spend a few minutes lighting a fire in the fireplace. It warms the room and lights it well. You almost feel comfortable for the first time today.\nEntryText:  Sitting down in the chair, you think over all that you have seen today. You know that the day is far from over, and you get the sense that you have just scratched the surface of what the house has to offer, and how owning it will change your life.\nEntryText:  After few moments of contemplation, your eyelids get heavy and drift off to sleep.\n\nChoice:Continue.\nAction:GOTO:561\n\nEntryID:561\nEntryText:  You find yourself standing on the bow of a large steam ship. The water churns below you, parting to let the ship glide through. Ahead fog and mist make it hard to see. \nEntryText:  The ship suddenly lurches and you are thrown into the railing ahead of you. When you grab the rail to steady yourself, you don't recognize the hands you see. The left hand has a large scar across the back and the hands are older than yours. You also don't recognize the clothing you are wearing.\nEntryText:  The ships horn sounds, a loud crashing noise that makes you clap your hands over your ears. There are yells and cries from elsewhere on the ship. Then you hear it, a roar, or a yell or something... undescribable coming from in front of the ship. \nEntryText:  Looking out you see the sea is boiling and forthing and jutting forth from it some 100 yards before the ship is a massive form, at least a hundred feet high sticking up from the water. Its huge head is shaped like an octopus. It body looks like that of a large person, with dark greenish skin. Massive wings jut from it's back. \n\nChoice:Flee from the sight in front of you.\nAction:GOTO:562\nChoice:Watch the creature.\nAction:GOTO:563\n\nEntryID:562\nEntryText:  Turning to flee you see men all staring up at the thing. In the middle of them all is a young woman who is smiling up at the creature, a look of rapture on her face. You stumble forward and grab a hold of her shoulders and shake her as she begins to laugh out loud. \nEntryText:  A voice that is not your own cries out from your mouth, \"Caroline, we must flee this place!\"\nEntryText:  She shakes her head and grabs your hands, \"Why father, isn't it the most beautiful thing you have ever seen?\"\nEntryText:  You turn to look again at the creature. A mighty arm swings forth, smashing into the water and the ship. As the wave crashes over you and the ship begins to list you start and wake up, still sitting in the chair. \nEntryText:  The fire crackles in the fireplace. Looking down at your hand, for a moment you think you can see the scar, then the moment passes and your hand looks like your own once more.\n\nEntryText:  \nEntryAction:MODIFY_ATTRIBUTE:CURRENT_PHYSICAL:25\nEntryAction:MODIFY_ATTRIBUTE:CURRENT_MENTAL:-15\nEntryAction:ADD_FLAG:Fireplace Lit\n\nChoice:Leave the study.\nAction:GOTO:51\n\nEntryID:563\nEntryText:  You laugh out loud gazing up at the marvelous, strange, and alien creature in front of you. You grip the rail and will yourself to stare at it, study it, even though every fiber of your being is telling you to run.\nEntryText:  A hand is placed over yours and you look over to see a young woman standing beside you. A look of happiness is etched into her face, and you can't help think it is the first time you have seen her happy in a long time. \nEntryText:  She smiles at you and then turns back to the creature. \"Why father, isn't it the most beautiful thing you have ever seen?\"\nEntryText:  You turn to look again at the creature. A mighty arm swings forth, smashing into the water and the ship. As the wave crashes over you and the ship begins to list you start and wake up, still sitting in the chair. \nEntryText:  The fire crackles in the fireplace. Looking down at your hand, for a moment you think you can see the scar, then the moment passes and your hand looks like your own once more.\n\nEntryText:  \nEntryAction:MODIFY_ATTRIBUTE:CURRENT_PHYSICAL:25\nEntryAction:MODIFY_ATTRIBUTE:CURRENT_MENTAL:-15\nEntryAction:ADD_FLAG:Fireplace Lit\n\nChoice:Leave the study.\nAction:GOTO:51\n\nEntryID:57\nEntryText:  Knowing you have no other means to light your way, you decide to take the lantern with you. The handle is comfortable in your grip and almost feels familiar to you.\nEntryText:  \nEntryText:  <color=green>Acquired Lantern</color>\nEntryAction:ADD_FLAG:Lantern Taken\n\nChoice:Light a fire in the fireplace.\nAction:GOTO:56\nRequirement:NOT_HAVE_FLAG:Fireplace Lit\nChoice:Examine the bookshelf.\nAction:GOTO:58\nChoice:Leave the study.\nAction:GOTO:51\n\n\nEntryID:58\nEntryText:  You look through the things on the shelves. The jars contain a weird assortment of random things. Most of them look like animal parts, but the names of the animals you don't recognize. You pick one up and shake it slightly and the within the suspension, a claw of some sort rotates slowly into view. Another jar contains what looks to be some sort of eyeball. You tap it and the liquid inside sloshes slightly, causing the eyeball to rotate more toward you.\nEntryText:  You move on to the books, and begin to examine them. The collection of title is very odd. References to cryptozoology, mythology, as well as some classics and more modern fare mingle all together in an eclectic collection. The fiction all leans toward the dark side, certainly not the sort of thing you would choose to curl up next to the fire with. One book is older than the rest, and when you flip it open, you don't recognize the symbols that you see within. The pictures inside are of animals you have never seen the like of.\n\nChoice:Examine the book further.\nAction:GOTO:59\nChoice:Light a fire in the fireplace.\nAction:GOTO:56\nRequirement:NOT_HAVE_FLAG:Fireplace Lit\nChoice:Take the lantern.\nAction:GOTO:57\nRequirement:NOT_HAVE_FLAG:Lantern Taken\nChoice:Leave the study.\nAction:GOTO:51\n\n\nEntryID:59\nEntryText:  You take the book over and sit down in the large chair. You imagine that your uncle must have sat here, probably with this very book. The fact that you never knew him and now own this whole place weighs on you for a bit, but then you push the thoughts aside and flip open the book again. \nEntryText:  The symbols still make no sense to you, but you keep flipping through the book, interested nonetheless. The creatures still look alien to you. Finally on one page you find writing that you can read scribbled in the margin next to a large creature which appears to have an octopus for a head.\nEntryText:  The note in the margin reads, \"The great old ones, like this Cthulhu are considered by most to be nothing but dark stories to scare people. I wonder at the power he is considered to have, and the alien mind he must possess. My research into him continues.\" \nEntryText:  Not having any idea what the whole book is about, much less the symbols, you close it and reshelve the book.\n\nChoice:Light a fire in the fireplace.\nAction:GOTO:56\nRequirement:NOT_HAVE_FLAG:Fireplace Lit\nChoice:Take the lantern.\nAction:GOTO:57\nRequirement:NOT_HAVE_FLAG:Lantern Taken\nChoice:Leave the study.\nAction:GOTO:51\n\n\nEntryID:60\nEntryText:  The sitting room is old, just like everything else in the house. Most of the furniture here is covered in old drop cloths. The cloths are in turn covered in layers of grime and dust. \nEntryText:  The only thing not covered in grime or a drop cloth are several old paintings that line one wall. The first painting depicts a man, the second painting a woman, and third painting a young girl.\nEntryText:  A door leads out of here to the foyer.\n\nChoice:Examine the painting of the man.\nAction:GOTO:61\nChoice:Examine the painting of the woman.\nAction:GOTO:62\nChoice:Examine the painting of the young girl.\nAction:GOTO:63\nChoice:Head through the open door back to the foyer.\nAction:GOTO:51\n\n\nEntryID:61\nEntryText:  The painting is a decade or two old. The plaque on the frame below it reads \"Gerith Coleman\", your uncle. \nEntryText:  He is in a well tailored suit, and holding a pipe. There is a long scar on the back of his hand. He looks very studious and serious, staring out into the room as if watching over his old house.\nEntryText:  Not for the first time today you wonder who Gerith Coleman was, and what he was like. Why did your parents never talk of your uncle?\n\nChoice:Examine the painting of the woman.\nAction:GOTO:62\nChoice:Examine the painting of the young girl.\nAction:GOTO:63\nChoice:Head through the open door back to the foyer.\nAction:GOTO:51\n\n\nEntryID:62\nEntryText:  This painting is well taken care of. Unlike the other two, there is very little dirt or dust on the frame or the glass. \nEntryText:  The subject is a younger woman. By the clothing she is wearing, a nice dress, but a bit outdated, you can tell the painting is a few decades old.

Perhaps this was your aunt and uncle's daughter? If so, you wonder what happened to her such that she was not given the house on your uncle's passing. She would have been your cousin.

They never listen.\"\nEntryText:  You swallow hard as the recording ends with Caroline laughing, joined by a deep guttural laugh. The needle finally reaches the end of the record and it begins to skip slowly, scratching noises coming from the phonograph as it continues to spin.\nEntryText:  Finally you reach up and lift the arm of the phonograph off, and turn the the phonograph off. Your eyes dart around the room, and you realize you've been holding your breath slightly so you let it out. \nEntryText:  Then you see it. \nEntryText:  In one corner one of the cloths rests over what could only be a piano.

The dog scrambles into the house barking its head off. \nEntryText:  Minutes later, James comes out, dragging the barking dog with him. \"Sorry, whoever or whatever it was is gone now. The back door wasn't locked up, so maybe they got out that way while we were out here.\" He shrugs a bit, but looks like he is telling you the truth.

Lock the place up, I need to head into town, but I'll be back.\" Someone in town will help you shed some light on this. After all you uncle worked at the university in town.

Either might have more information.\nEntryText:  At the library, you know you can pour over many old texts about Arkham and its surroundings. It would take some time, but nothing some dogged determination can't handle.\nEntryText:  The Arkham Advertiser on the other hand means dealing with the local reporters, editors, or archivists. Getting them to give up information when there is no story to be had will take some convincing.\nEntryText:  Of course, you are burning daylight, and you have a bit of a drive ahead of you.

The hours go by, and most of what you find is rather dull.

The dig was mildly successful in uncovering several artifacts including a ceremonial mask. \nEntryText:  Unfortunately, before the dig could be completed, things started going wrong.

The eyes are sunken in, the skin is taut, and his lips are pulled back in a snarl.

They don't really do much to dispel the gloom downstairs, but at least you don't run into things. Julie walks over to one door, and uses one of the keys on a massive keyring to unlatch the heavy old door. \nEntryText:  Once it is open she slips in, clicking on another light, then turns to rows and rows of boxes. \"Let's see. I think... ah yes. Here we go.\" She pulls a box off one shelf and starts leafing through things. \"I remember there was something out there several years back. Had to do with the University.\" She flips through many sheafs of paper before finally stopping on one and handing it to you. \"There you go.\"\nEntryText:  The article outlines how your uncle paid for an archaeological dig on his land. Apparently a prehistoric burial ground was located in the woods behind the house, and your uncle worked with Miskatonic University to have it excavated. The dig went well for a while, producing several rare artifacts, including a ceremonial mask. Things started to fall apart though, after an accident at the dig site left one worker dead, and a break in at Miskatonic University resulted in the theft of most of the major artifacts. Your Uncle pulled the plug after that.\n\nChoice:Continue\nAction:GOTO:6\n\n\nEntryID:6\nEntryText:  Julie smiles, \"I wish I had more for you, but that is really all the detail there is from then.\"\nEntryText:  You go over the article one more time, scanning for anything else that will tell you anything, but it is mostly generalities and reactions from locals and University officials.\nEntryText:  \"I really appreciate this, Julie.\" You smile and hand her back the article. She refiles it, then clicks the light off as you both turn to walk out of the archives. \nEntryText:  \"I hope it was enough.

Glancing to one side, you see a shadow slip back into an alleyway beside the paper. Something tells you, whoever it was, they were watching you.\nEntryText:  Slamming your car door shut, you start the car and drive passed the alley. Standing in the back of the alley, drenched in rain and covered in shadow is a hooded figure, watching you intently. You stop the car, and step out, determined to confront the man. \nEntryText:  Lightning flashes, and in the brighter light, you swear that the man's face is covered in something. The eyes are massive, the lips curled in a snarl. It must be a mask. Right?\nEntryText:  As you eyes readjust to the light, you step forward, \"You there!\" You begin toward the figure just as they turn to one side, running from sight. You make the corner fast enough, feet splashing through the puddles as you run. \nEntryText:  When you turn the corner though, no one is there. You look up the sides of the buildings, and back the way you came, but see no signs of the masked figure. \n\nChoice:You take a breath, then head back to your car and out of the rain.\nAction:GOTO:20\n\n\nEntryID:18\nEntryText:  \"Thank you so much, you are too kind.\" You look around her office as she closes the door. \"Nice office you have here, Julie.

I grew up here, and I'm the best one qualified to run it.\"\nEntryText:  \"Of course, I didn't mean to offend.

When you get to the bottom of the shaft you see it opens up behind you, and turn slowly around.\nEntryText:  The stone chamber before you makes your skin crawl just by looking at it. Dark stains mar the stone surface in various locations. A massive table, stained dark and crusted with unknown substances sits in the middle of the room.

You decide to leave them alone.\n\nChoice:Examine the table.\nAction:GOTO:113\nChoice:Examine the doll.\nAction:GOTO:125\nChoice:Climb back up the ladder.\nAction:GOTO:70\n\nEntryID:125\nEntryText:  You go over and look at the doll. It is a cloth body doll, with a wooden carved head. If it had clothes, they are missing now. The head is worn, and chipped. The paint on one eye is starting to fade, making it look different than the other eye.\nEntryText:  The body of the doll is stained and worn, the stuffing inside has compacted over the years, so now the skin of the doll hangs far looser than it should. \nEntryText:  Something about the doll just gives you the creeps. It could be the old faded paint, or the worn stained body. Or maybe it is the fact that it is a doll, in what looks to be a dungeon. Either way, you decide to leave it be.\nEntryText:  \nEntryText:  <color=maroon>Current Mental -5 (Creepy)</color>\nEntryAction:MODIFY_ATTRIBUTE:CURRENT_MENTAL:-5\n\nChoice:Examine the table.\nAction:GOTO:113\nChoice:Examine the manacles.\nAction:GOTO:124\nChoice:Climb back up the ladder.\nAction:GOTO:70\n\n\nChoice__:Examine the grandfather clock.\nAction__:GOTO:130\n\nEntryID:130\nEntryText:  The grandfather clock is rather massive. It is seven feet of ancient carved wood, gears, pendulums, and fine craftsmanship. The carvings are very gothic in nature, and the face is very ornate.\nEntryText:  After studying it for a few minutes though, you realize that something is off about the pendulum. It seems to be swinging further to right than to the left. This makes every other tick of the clock slightly longer.\nEntryText:  The effect is maddening after a few moments, once you hear it, you can not unhear it, and all you can think of is how the clock is just not right.\n\nChoice:Examine the pendulum.\nAction:GOTO:131\nChoice:Examine the face.\nAction:GOTO:132\nChoice:Leave the clock alone.\nAction:GOTO:70\n\n\nEntrID:131\nEntryText:  The pendulum is easy enough to manipulate. You could grab it to stop it or start it swinging again.\n\nChoice:Ensure the pendulum is swinging.\nAction:GOTO:133\nChoice:Stop the pendulum from swinging any more.\nAction:REQUIREMENT_CHECK:FLAGS:Minute Hand at 12:Hour Hand at 12\nActionCheckSuccess:GOTO:134\nActionCheckFailure:GOTO:137\nChoice:Leave the clock alone.\nAction:GOTO:70\n\n\nEntryID:132\nEntryText:  The ornate face is easy to access by pulling open the glass cover that protects it. \n\nChoice:Set the minute hand.\nAction:GOTO:135\nChoice:Set the hour hand.\nAction:GOTO:136\nChoice:Leave the clock alone.\nAction:GOTO:70\n\n\nEntryID:133\nEntryText:  You start the pendulum swinging again.\n\nChoice:Examine the face.\nAction:GOTO:132\nChoice:Leave the clock alone.\nAction:GOTO:70\n\n\nEntryID:134\nEntryText:  You stop the pendulum and suddenly the clock begins to sound. Thirteen times it chimes, and then with a low grinding noise, the clock slides out of the way, revealing a dark passage way down.\n\nChoice:Check out the passage.\nAction:GOTO:110\nChoice:Dark passages are scary, not going.\nAction:GOTO:70\n\n\nEntryID:135\nEntryText:  What do you want to set the minute hand to?\n\nChoice:Somewhere between 1 and 4\nAction:GOTO:137\nChoice:Somewhere between 5 and 8\nAction:GOTO:138\nChoice:Somewhere between 9 and 12\nAction:GOTO:139\nChoice:Leave the clock alone.\nAction:GOTO:70\n\n\nEntryID:136\nEntryText:  What do you want to set the hour hand to?\n\nChoice:Somewhere between 1 and 4\nAction:GOTO:140\nChoice:Somewhere between 5 and 8\nAction:GOTO:141\nChoice:Somewhere between 9 and 12\nAction:GOTO:142\nChoice:Leave the clock alone.\nAction:GOTO:70\n\n",
