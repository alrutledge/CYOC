EntryText:  You collapse from your wounds, exhaustion, or pain. You are not really sure which. In the darkness that follows, you see cloaked men, and horrible things that can not possibly exist. You see the end of all times, or at least your end.
EntryText:  
EntryText:  Your adventure has ended. 
EntryText:  
EntryText:  Welcome to a pine box.


EntryID:-1
EntryText:  You have gone insane. Your mind reels from the impossibility of it all, then finally snaps. You see things that can not be possible.

EntryText:  Your adventure has ended.

EntryText:  Welcome to a padded room.


EntryID:0
EntryText:  It is 1925. 
EntryText:  A telegram arrived for you late last night. An uncle you did not even know you had apparently passed recently. In his will, he left his entire estate to you.
EntryText:  Apparently the estate consists of the home and lands at 15607 Old Hill Rd just outside of town. 
EntryText:  As luck would have it, you had no other plans for the day, so you have decided that you should drive out there and examine your new property. 
EntryText:  Maybe it, or something within, will be worth something to you. At least, you will be able to learn more about this uncle that you did not even know you had.
EntryText:  As you pack your things for a day trip and get into your car, it occurs to you that perhaps before you go out to the house you could do a bit of research to find out more about the place.

Choice:Research the house before going out there.
Action:GOTO:1
Choice:Take the drive out to 15607 Old Hill Rd.
Action:GOTO:20


EntryID:1
EntryText:  Two places within town immediately come to mind. The library and the Arkham Advertiser, the local newspaper. Either might have more information.
EntryText:  At the library, you know you can pour over many old texts about Arkham and its surroundings. It would take some time, but nothing some dogged determination can't handle.
EntryText:  The Arkham Advertiser on the other hand means dealing with the local reporters, editors, or archivists. Getting them to give up information when there is no story to be had will take some convincing.
EntryText:  Of course, you are burning daylight, and you have a bit of a drive ahead of you. Perhaps it would best to skip all this and head out to the house. After all, it is just a house, what more would you need to know than that?

Choice:Nevermind the research. You decide to head out to the house.
Action:GOTO:20
Choice:The library sounds up your speed with its dusty old tomes and research.
Action:GOTO:2
Choice:The Arkham Advertiser is the better choice. If there is information to be had, reporters will know!
Action:GOTO:10


EntryID:2
Note:Library
EntryText:  You pull up outside the library and step out of your car, just as a thunderclap sounds overhead. Dark storm clouds have been gathering all morning and it looks like they will finally let loose the rain soon.
EntryText:  Managing to get inside just before the rain hits, you settle into to dig through the ancient books and periodicals. The hours go by, and most of what you find is rather dull. Nothing really sparks your interest immediately.
EntryText:  You are reshelving a book on the history of Arkham and its surrounding areas when you get the feeling that something is watching you. You turn to look, but nothing is there but rows upon rows of books. 
EntryText:  Shaking off the feeling you dive back into the search, hoping that something fruitful will turn up soon.

EntryID:3
Note:Library Success
EntryText:  You find one interesting article tucked away in the archives. It is from five years back. Apparently your uncle paid a large sum to Miskatonic University for them to perform an archaelogical dig on his land. 
EntryText:  It turns out the land was a former native burial ground. The dig was mildly successful in uncovering several artifacts including a ceremonial mask. 
EntryText:  Unfortunately, before the dig could be completed, things started going wrong. First there was an accident on the site. Then several of the key artifacts were stolen. Eventually your uncle decided to stop funding the dig.

EntryText:  Try as you might, you can't seem to find anything very interesting about the house or the land surrounding it. You find yourself struggling to stay focused on the task and eventually give up in frustration.

EntryText:  As you reshelve the final book you turn to find a man standing in the shadows of the rack of books ahead of you. Shadows cover his features, and he slowly shakes his head. 
EntryText:  Lightning flashes, and when his face is illuminated, it is a horror to behold. The eyes are sunken in, the skin is taut, and his lips are pulled back in a snarl. You start back as the lightning flash fades and run into a librarian walking through the stacks.
EntryText:  She starts as you bump into her and says, "Oh, terribly sorry. Are you alright?"
EntryText:  You look back to where the figure was standing, but he is gone. Swallowing away the fear, you shake your head and straight your clothes, "Yes, fine, thank you. Excuse me."

Note:Newspaper, non-reporter
EntryText:  You pull up outside the building that houses the Arkham Advertiser, just as a thunderclap sounds overhead. Storm clouds have been gathering all morning and they finally let loose just as you step out of your car. 
EntryText:  You race to the door, the rain slicking your hair to your head. As you get to the door a woman opens it for your from the inside and smiles, "Quickly, come in!" She laughs gently at your condition and waits for you to gather yourself before saying, "Welcome to the Arkham Advertiser. I'm Julie, the editor of the paper. What can I do for you?"

Choice:Introduce yourself and tell her that you need information.
Action:GOTO:11
Choice:Make small talk to try and get on her good side.

EntryText:  You introduce yourself then get to the point, "I'm looking for information on the area out Old Hill Road. I was hoping you might know something of the area."
EntryText:  She nods curtly and leads you back, "Why are you interested in that area? It's very remote." She closes the door of her office behind you and sits down behind her desk.

Choice:Tell her the truth.

EntryText:  You tell Julie the truth. "My uncle lived out there, and he recently passed."
EntryText:  Julie gives you her best pity look, "I'm so sorry." You wave her off.
EntryText:  "It's okay. I didn't really know him. The thing is, he left me the property, and I have no idea what I am getting into."

Choice:You follow Julie to the archives.
Action:GOTO:16


EntryID:13
EntryText:  You tell Julie the truth. "My uncle lived out there, and he recently passed."
EntryText:  Julie starts to give you her best pity look, "I'm so sor-" 
EntryText:  You cut her off. "I never met him, but he did leave me the property. I just want to know what I have."
EntryText:  Julie looks you up and down a moment then shrugs, "I can't really say. I don't know anything about that area." She stands, "Now if you will excuse me, I have work to do."

Choice:You leave Julie's office, dissappointed.
Action:GOTO:17
